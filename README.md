sha3sum
=======

This is a small implementation of sha3sum programs (`sha3-224sum`, `sha3-256sum`, `sha3-384sum`, `sha3-512sum`), using the Nettle library.

(I just wanted a quick sha3sum program and the Nettle library happened to be installed. There’s already a more full-featured version of sha3sum programs out there, so there’s not really any reason to use this.)
